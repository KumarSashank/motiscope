# motiscope: recreate

> Recreate an analyzed animation as working web code — GSAP (JavaScript), CSS/Web Animations, Framer Motion (React), or Lottie/SVG. Use after `motiscope-analyze`, or when the user asks to "build/recreate this animation in <framework>". Reads the motiscope animation spec and emits a runnable component.

**Arguments** (`[gsap|css|framer|lottie] [output-dir]`): take them from the user's message. If they're missing, infer them or ask.

## Running motiscope

`motiscope` is a shell command. If it isn't found it isn't on your PATH — see
https://github.com/KumarSashank/motiscope#install. The reference guides live under
`$(motiscope home)/references/`.

**Invoking the sibling skills.** In Codex, mention a skill with `$motiscope-recreate`. In
Cursor, use `/motiscope-recreate`. Elsewhere, just follow that skill's `SKILL.md`.

**Seeing the frames — do not skip this.** The curated keyframes are PNG files on disk, and
you must actually look at them. Codex: use the `view_image` tool (if it's unavailable,
enable `tools.view_image = true` in `~/.codex/config.toml`, or have the user relaunch with
`codex -i frame1.png,frame2.png`). Cursor: the file-reading tool accepts `.png` and puts
the image in context. If you genuinely cannot open images, **say so** — you can still
report the measured timing, but you cannot know *what* is animating, and you must not
guess it from the filenames.

Translate a motiscope **animation spec** into real, runnable animation code for one target framework. Timing and easing come from the measured spec; you render it faithfully.


## Step 1 — load the animation spec

- If ``motiscope-analyze`` just produced a spec in this conversation, use it.
- Otherwise locate the most recent analysis and read it:
  ```bash
  ls -t .motiscope/*/manifest.json 2>/dev/null | head -1
  ```
  Read that `manifest.json` (and its sibling `motion.json` for the raw energy curve / segments). If there is none, run ``motiscope-analyze`` first.

## Step 2 — choose the target

- From `$1` if given (`gsap` | `css` | `framer` | `lottie`).
- Otherwise read the default and ask:
  ```bash
  motiscope config   # prints config incl. default_target
  ```
  Ask the user to confirm the target (offer all four; default from config).

Then Read the target guide and the easing map:
- read `$(motiscope home)/references/easing-map.md` — maps each neutral ease token to a concrete value in every target.
- read `$(motiscope home)/references/targets/<target>.md` — the rendering template for that target.
- read `$(motiscope home)/references/measurement-traps.md` — **if you are deriving any number yourself** (a velocity, a parallax ratio, a period) rather than reading it from `report.md`.

## Step 3 — generate the code

**Split of responsibility (mirror the spec):**
- **Timing is measured — use it exactly.** `start_ms`, `dur_ms`, the `bezier`, stagger `each_ms`, loop `period_ms` come from motiscope's analysis; wire them verbatim (prefer the exact `cubic-bezier` over a named ease).
- **The *effect* is yours — build what the spec's `animation` field and the frames describe.** You are **not** limited to opacity/translate/scale. If the animation is a mask/clip-path reveal, an SVG path draw, a morph, a 3D flip, a text split/typewriter, a blur or color shift, a parallax, a spring/physics bounce, or particles — **build that directly in the target**, going beyond the spec's simple `props` when needed. Re-Read the frames if you need to confirm the effect.

Map each timeline entry to the target (per-element `from`/`to`, the measured `dur_ms`/`start_ms`/`bezier`, stagger), then implement the described effect.

For **GSAP**, write idiomatic GSAP yourself: build the sequence with a `gsap.timeline()` and the position parameter, register a `CustomEase` for each measured `cubic-bezier`, use `stagger` for the measured `each_ms`, and reach for `ScrollTrigger` **only if** the spec has `"scroll_driven": true`. The rendering template in `$(motiscope home)/references/targets/gsap.md` has the patterns.

For **css**, **framer**, **lottie**, follow the corresponding `references/targets/<target>.md` template.

Always include a `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` guard that drops the element(s) into their final state.

**If the spec is `scroll_driven`:** bind the motion to scroll position, not to a timer. A layer with parallax factor `f` translates by `scroll x (1 - f)`; at `f = 0` it is pinned, at `f = 1` it rides the page. A time-driven object inside a scroll-driven scene (a train, a marquee) can be bound to scroll too — derive its constant from the recorded *ratio*, and say in your summary that the binding is a design decision rather than something the source did.

**A backdrop must not have an edge.** Anything that reads as *behind everything* — a sky, a page gradient, a vignette — belongs to the container, not to a moving layer. A gradient drawn as a `<rect>` inside a parallax layer has a top edge, and any travel large enough slides that edge into frame. If you are clamping travel to keep a background from being uncovered, you are bounding the symptom; remove the edge instead. And beware composition you never chose: tracing a frame recovers ridge *shapes* and layer *speeds*, never where the horizon should sit. That part is yours — say so.

**Verify in the substrate, not in your own render.** Re-measuring pixels of your own output is a second chance to be wrong the same way. Ask the runtime what it actually resolved — `getBoundingClientRect`, `getComputedStyle`, `getBBox`, `DOMMatrix` — and check the numbers against the spec. A layer's on-screen speed relative to the page *is* its parallax factor; that is a proof, a screenshot is not.

## Step 4 — asset check (consent flow)

If the spec references an image/video asset (a hero image, a looping background, a texture), resolve it **before** writing code — ask the user:
1. **Point at an existing file** the user already has (preferred) — wire its path in.
2. **Generate one** — check what's configured, then generate:
   ```bash
   motiscope assets --check
   motiscope assets generate --type image --provider <name> --prompt "<desc>" --out "<path>"
   ```
   If no key is configured, ask the user for the provider and hand off to ``motiscope-doctor`` to store the key. **Image generation is real via the `gemini`/`imagen` provider** (Imagen through the Gemini API — set `GEMINI_API_KEY`); pass `--aspect-ratio 16:9|4:3|1:1|3:4|9:16`. Other providers still write a labeled placeholder — if you get one, tell the user to use `gemini` or swap in a real asset.
3. **Use a placeholder** — a neutral colored box, and note it.

Never write API keys into generated code or commit them.

## Step 5 — write the output

Write to `[output-dir]` (`$2`), default `./motiscope-output/<target>/`. Include a **minimal runnable harness** so the user can preview immediately:
- **gsap / css** → a self-contained `index.html` (CDN GSAP for the gsap target) that plays the animation on load.
- **framer** → a `.tsx` component plus a one-line usage note (and the `framer-motion` install command).
- **lottie** → the animated SVG (or `.json`) plus a note on how to embed/play it.

## Step 6 — tell the user how to preview + what to tune

- Give the exact preview step (e.g. "open `motiscope-output/css/index.html`").
- List which values are **exact** (timing, easing, sequence — measured) vs **estimated** (transform magnitudes, colors, overshoot — eyeballed from frames) so they know precisely what to nudge. Offer to iterate.
